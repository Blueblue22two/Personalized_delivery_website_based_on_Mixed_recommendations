## ðŸ“œHybrid Recommendation system:
> This project combines two different recommendation algorithms in terms of weights.  
### Collaborative Filtering:  
- User-CF:  
> we use ***Adjusted Cosine Similarity (John.S.Breese)*** to calculate the similarity between user, and store it in *user similarity matrix*.   

### Content-based recommendation:  
> Using  ***Jaccard index*** to measure the similarity of item.  

In addition, we also create a **popularity-based recommendation function** to recommend items based only on the data of the item itself (such as sales and number of favorites), which solves the ***cold start*** problem of the above two recommendation algorithms.
